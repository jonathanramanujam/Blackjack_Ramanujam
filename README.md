# Blackjack_Ramanujam
This is my Blackjack project, which was built using C# and ASP.net.

The "main" branch shows the work I was able to complete in the initial 4 hours. The UI is very minimal, though the backend logic has been largely implemented.

If you are interested, the "adding-bootstrap" branch adds a little bit of frontend to the project. Another couple of hours beyond the 4 allocated hours was spent here. Individual cards in this branch are displayed as playing cards with icons for suits.
